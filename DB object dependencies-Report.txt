DB object dependencies

 The script will provide the list of all programmable DB objects and the objects being refered.

The objective of the script is to have a map of your database dependencies in the form of view for debugging and analysis purpose.

The known limitation all such methods is that we cannot dig in to map dependencies where dynamic queries are used.




CREATE view [dbobject_dependency_mapping]
as
select 
 referencing.*,
 referenced.child_dbobject_id,
 referenced.child_dbbobject_schema,
 referenced.child_dbobject,
 referenced.child_dbobject_type
from
(
 select 
  [object_id] [dbobject_id],
  schema_name([schema_id]) [dbobject_schema],
  name [dbobject],
  type_desc [dbobject_type]
 from sys.objects
 where [type] not in ('D','IT','PK','SQ','UQ','U','S','TR')
) referencing
left outer join
(
 select 
  id [parent_dbobject_id],
  depid [child_dbobject_id],
  schema_name([schema_id]) [child_dbbobject_schema],
  name [child_dbobject],
